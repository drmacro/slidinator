This is not a proper toolkit plugin yet. Need direction on how to handle given the current slideset transform is meant (?) to transform dita to slideset to pptx.

Currently the output directory is a subdirectory of the xsl directory called slidy. A copy of the needed resources live there as they are needed in the interim until this is properly configured as a toolkit plugin.
