The Slidinator
==============

Java and XSLT framework for generating slide presentations from a general XML master format that is easy to transform to. 

*NOTE:* The focus to date on Slidinator implementation has been to simply make generation of the Powerpoint (PPTX) files work _at all_. To date there has been insufficient scope to address the full range of use cases that would be need to make The Slidinator fully useful.

In particular, for DITA Use, the current DITA-to-SimpleSlideSet transform only handles flat maps: nested topics are not handled (See https://github.com/drmacro/slidinator/issues/5). 

Contributions are of course encouraged and welcomed but as of October 2014 I (Eliot Kimber) do not have any client requirement or pressing personal need to further develop The Slidinator so I don't have any near-term plans to extend the code. If this is something you need, feel free to extend it as you need to or you can engage me at my Open Source rate to further develop the code.
